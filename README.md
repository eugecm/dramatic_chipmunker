# dramatic chipmunker

A Frogger clone written for one of my classes, code is in spanish for this
reason. It may serve as an example of how to write basic asm. This program
needs to be run in real mode so you'll probably need an emulator such as
DOSBox.

Run the bat script to compile and link.

The name comes from the viral video "Dramatic Chipmunk".
